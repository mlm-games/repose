## Repose

Native Rust UI for mobile and desktop. No VM, no WebView, no garbage collector. One codebase, GPU-accelerated everywhere.

Currently has no documentation, can view the examples or my rust app soredowe for reference to start building. (pre-release stage but apis might not change drastically due to it being based off the stable compose api)

## License

GPLv3.0 currently (can dual license it if anyone wants to build proprietory apps with it...)
